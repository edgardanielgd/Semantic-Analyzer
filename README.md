# Translator from SmallBasic to Javascript

## Description

This is a translator from SmallBasic to Javascript. It is implemented using Antlr4 and Java 8.
The translator is able to translate the following SmallBasic code (as example):

```SmallBasic
Sub ola
    cosa = 2
    If (olademar = 4 + 2 * 3) Then
        cosa = 3*2 <= 6
        For i = 2 To 4 Step 2
            cosa = 3*2 <= 6
        EndFor
    EndIf
    While (algo - 3*2 <= 6)
        algo = 3*2 <= 6
        If (casita And casita2 And casita3 And "False") Then
            TextWindow.WriteLine("Hola")
            Program.Delay(200)

            ' Oalaflsdfls'
            For k = 2 To 5 Step 3
                TextWindow.WriteLine("Hola")
                Program.Delay(200)
            EndFor

            For b = 2 To 10
                Stack.PushValue("myarray", b)
            EndFor

            ola()

            count = Stack.PopValue("myarray")
            TextWindow.WriteLine(count)
        EndIf
    EndWhile
EndSub

a = TextWindow.ReadNumber()
b = TextWindow.ReadNumber()
c = a + b
If (c > 3) Then
    TextWindow.WriteLine("Hola")
Else
    TextWindow.WriteLine("Adios")
EndIf

a = 2
b = 50 * x[3][2][1]
TextWindow.WriteLine( b )
a["3"][2][False][2*3+2] = a["3"][2]


If (casita = 2) Then
    TextWindow.WriteLine("Hola")
Else
    TextWindow.WriteLine("Adios")
EndIf

For i = 2 To 4 Step 2
    TextWindow.WriteLine("Hola")
    Program.Delay(200)
EndFor

TextWindow.WriteLine("Wassup")
```

## Dependencies

* Java 8
* Antlr4

## Translator limitations

The translator can't translate the labels and the goto instruction from Small Basic because of the inexistance of those instructions in Javascript.
It's possible to translate the labels and the goto instruccion using the instruccion while in javascript and some "tricks", but it doesn't work in all the cases
and make the code illegible.

## Notes

The console was simulated with the abilities of the browser, so it's not possible to use the console in the same way as in SmallBasic.
If you want to see the result of the execution of the program, you can open the HTML file, generated by the translator, in a browser.

The latest version of the translator is in the latest UNcode upload.
